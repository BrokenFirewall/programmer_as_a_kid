# Programmer as a kid

This folder contains a small part of the software that I wrote when I was studying at school and was already in love with coding.

I shared these codes for educational purposes, as a first approach to programming.

## Some informations about myself

My passion for information technology (and technology in general) was born as a child; at school I was lucky enough to meet teachers who gave me the opportunity to express myself.

This repository contains only a small fraction of the programs I wrote as a high school student (from 14 to 18).
At that time I was attracted by video games and cryptography, my curiosity led me to know different sectors of the software world.

## Some informations about the code

I haven't changed the code, it's all original, the last changes date back to 2015.

In this code you can find errors, no best choice, comments and more.

# How to use the code

The programs was writen using Eclipse Luna, is all compatible with Java 17 SE.

Inside the repositories you can find only the .java files, simple follow these steps to use the code:

- create a new project
- create a new class file
- past the code
- run
